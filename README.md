![Image demonstration](./assets/appDemo.png)


# How to install and run the project
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

## Overview

The project involves creating a static web page form that utilizes Express.js and PostgreSQL to make AJAX requests to the database. The form's primary functionality is to add new visitors to the database seamlessly. Additionally, the project includes designing an HTML table and populating it using AJAX with data fetched from an existing API endpoint. An important feature is the implementation of 'delete' functionality, allowing users to remove visitors from the database directly from the web page. Furthermore, the web page is designed to automatically update the table without requiring a page refresh whenever a visitor is added or removed, providing a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** A JavaScript library for building mobile user interfaces.
- **CSS:** Custom styling for the overall appearance.
- **Postgresql:** For storing form input to the database
- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Ajax**: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, used for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
